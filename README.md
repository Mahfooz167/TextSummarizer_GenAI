## 🧠 Project Overview
Welcome to the **Text Summarizer (Generative AI)** project — a modern NLP application designed to help users quickly understand long documents, articles, and content by generating high-quality summaries using Transformer-based models.

This project demonstrates **end-to-end GenAI development**, from model inference to web deployment, and runs continuously on **Hugging Face Spaces**.

## 📌 Problem Statement
In today’s digital world, users are overwhelmed with large volumes of text such as:
- Articles
- Blogs
- Reports
- Documentation

Manually reading and extracting key information is **time-consuming and inefficient**.  
This project solves the problem by using **abstractive text summarization**, allowing users to focus only on the most important information.
